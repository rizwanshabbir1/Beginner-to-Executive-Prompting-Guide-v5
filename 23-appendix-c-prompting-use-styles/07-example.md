## Example:

Develop a customer journey narrative that illustrates the experience of a first-time user of our home meal kit delivery service. Create a specific persona and walk through their experience from discovery to first order to fourth month of usage, highlighting key touchpoints, emotional responses, and decision factors at each stage. The narrative should feel authentic and highlight both positive aspects and potential friction points.
