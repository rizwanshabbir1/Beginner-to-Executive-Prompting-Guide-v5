## Directive Style

Best for: Specific, well-defined outputs where you know exactly what you want. Characteristics: Clear instructions, specific parameters, explicit format requirements. Example:

Create a 5-day social media content calendar for a fitness brand launching a new protein powder. Include one post per day with the following for each: platform (alternate between Instagram and Facebook), post copy (maximum 100 words), hashtag suggestions (3-5), and optimal posting time. Each post should highlight a different benefit of the product.
