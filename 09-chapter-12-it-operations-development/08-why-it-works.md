title: Why It Works
---

## Why It Works:

- Sets a role (code reviewer) and requests a step-by-step explanation, prompting the AI to fully articulate the code's logic before giving the commented version.
- Combines descriptive output (explanation) with a concrete result (commented code), ensuring the AI not only interprets the code but also demonstrates how to document it.
Optional Add-On: Add "Point out any potential issues or improvements in the code as well." to get deeper insights beyond just explanation.
