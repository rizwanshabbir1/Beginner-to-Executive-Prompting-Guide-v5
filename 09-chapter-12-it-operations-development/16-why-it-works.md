## Why It Works:

- Example command outputs help responders accurately interpret results.
- Communication templates prevent critical messaging delays during incidents. Optional Add-On: "Add estimated time-to-resolution ranges for each remediation path." Bonus Prompt: Technical Design Document
As a solutions architect, create a comprehensive technical design document for our [SYSTEM/APPLICATION] implementation.





Include these components:

- System overview and architecture diagram
- Component descriptions with responsibilities and interactions
- API specifications and data models
- Infrastructure requirements and deployment approach
- Security considerations and controls
- Performance expectations and scaling approach
- Monitoring and logging strategy
- Dependencies and integration points
- 
Format as a technical design specification that provides sufficient detail for implementation while highlighting key architectural decisions and their rationales.
