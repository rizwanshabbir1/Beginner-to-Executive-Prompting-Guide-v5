## Introduction

IT operations and development professionals design, build, and maintain the

technological infrastructure and applications that power modern organizations. AI prompting can enhance these functions by debugging code, documenting systems, troubleshooting issues, and creating development specifications. The prompts in this chapter help IT teams work more efficiently while maintaining system reliability and code quality.

Effective IT and development prompting requires technical precision, methodological frameworks, and clear documentation practices that transform complex technical concepts into actionable guidance. These specialized prompt frameworks support the full technology lifecycle—from requirements gathering and development through deployment, monitoring, and incident response—while adapting to various technical contexts, from infrastructure management to application development.
