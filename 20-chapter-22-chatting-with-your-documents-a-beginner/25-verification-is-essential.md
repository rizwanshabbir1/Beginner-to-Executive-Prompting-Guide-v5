## Verification is Essential

- Cross-check critical information: While AI is powerful, it can misinterpret documents or make mistakes.
- Request citations: Ask the AI to point to specific pages or sections when providing information.
- Verify complex calculations: Double-check financial calculations or statistical analyses against the original figures.
