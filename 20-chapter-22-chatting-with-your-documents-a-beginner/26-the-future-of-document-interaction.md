## The Future of Document Interaction

As RAG technology continues to evolve, we can expect more sophisticated document interactions, including:

- Multi-document analysis: Asking questions across several documents simultaneously
- Visual element interpretation: Better understanding of charts, graphs, and images within documents
- Temporal awareness: Understanding date-dependent information and tracking changes across document versions
- More specialized document handling: Improved capabilities for industry-specific documents like medical records or technical specifications
