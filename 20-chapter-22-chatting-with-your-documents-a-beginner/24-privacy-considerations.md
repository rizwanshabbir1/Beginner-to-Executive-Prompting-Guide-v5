- Redact sensitive information: Remove or black out confidential details before uploading when possible.
- Review platform policies: Understand how each AI platform handles and stores the documents you upload.
- Consider alternatives: For highly sensitive materials, consider copying only relevant non-sensitive sections rather than uploading entire documents.
