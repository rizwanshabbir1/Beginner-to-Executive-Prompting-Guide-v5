## Handling Large Documents

- Chunk strategically: If your document exceeds upload limits, divide it logically (by chapters, sections, or periods) to ensure efficient uploading.
- 
- Provide context: When uploading portions of a larger document, briefly explain how this section relates to the overall document.
- Use sequential analysis: Upload and analyze one section at a time, building on insights from previous sections.
