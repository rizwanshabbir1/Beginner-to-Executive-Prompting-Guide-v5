## Bonus Prompt: Financial Variance Analysis

As an FP&A manager, conduct a comprehensive variance analysis of our Q2 financial performance against both budget and the previous year.





For each major P&L line item:

- Calculate absolute and percentage variances against budget and YoY
- Identify and explain the three most considerable variances, breaking down contributing factors
- Categorize each significant variance as volume-driven, price/rate-driven, or mix-driven
- Recommend specific actions to address unfavorable variances
- Project the impact on full-year forecast if current trends continue




Format as a variance analysis report suitable for executive review, with both tabular data and narrative explanation.
