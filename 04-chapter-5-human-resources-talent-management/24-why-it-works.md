title: Why It Works
---

## Why It Works:

- Gives clear instructions (role and number of insights), so the AI knows to focus on top insights (examples provided) rather than give a generic summary
- Structured output (bullet list of insights) ensures the summary is concise and easy to scan, matching best practices for executive briefings.
Optional Add-On: Append "Include one supporting figure for each insight." to incorporate key numbers into the summary.
