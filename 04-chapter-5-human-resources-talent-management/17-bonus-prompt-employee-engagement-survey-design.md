## Bonus Prompt: Employee Engagement Survey Design

As an employee experience researcher, design a comprehensive engagement survey for our organization of [SIZE] employees across [NUMBER] departments.





Create a survey framework that includes the following:

Format this as a complete survey instrument, ready for deployment, with an introduction that explains the purpose and confidentiality.
