title: Why It Works

## Why It Works:

- Outlines the task in clear steps (extract keywords, then integrate), guiding the model in a logical sequence.
- Requests a structured output (two-column table) to ensure organized and actionable recommendations.
Optional Add-On: Append "Make sure to use the exact phrasing from the job description for each skill." to maximize alignment.
