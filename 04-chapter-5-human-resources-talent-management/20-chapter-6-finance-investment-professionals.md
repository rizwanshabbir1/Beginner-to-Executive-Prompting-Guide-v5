"Prompt engineering should NOT be underestimated. Many complex customer problems can be solved without fine-tuning the LLM model." - (Attributed to an AI conference at MIT).





Financial professionals require precision, analytical rigor, and clear communication of complex concepts. AI prompting can help analyze financial data, identify trends, model



scenarios, and translate technical information into actionable insights. The prompts in this chapter enable finance teams to accelerate analysis, improve decision-making, and communicate financial information effectively to various stakeholders.
