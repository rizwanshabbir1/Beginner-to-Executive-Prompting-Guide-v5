title: Why It Works
---

## Why It Works:

- Combines calculation with interpretation—explicitly asking for numbers and analysis—so the AI provides context rather than just math.
- Specifying exact ratios and years gives focus and ensures the AI organizes the output logically (for example, by year or by ratio).
Optional Add-On: Add "Present the ratios in a table before the analysis." to get a clear numeric summary followed by an explanation.
