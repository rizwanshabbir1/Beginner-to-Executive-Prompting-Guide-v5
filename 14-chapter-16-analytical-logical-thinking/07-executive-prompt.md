## Executive Prompt:

As a systems analyst, conduct a structured comparison of [APPROACH A],

[APPROACH B], and [APPROACH C] for addressing [SITUATION/PROBLEM].





For each approach:

- Summarize the core methodology and underlying assumptions
- Evaluate against five key dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, risk, scalability, and implementation requirements
- Identify specific scenarios where each would be optimal
- Document limitations and potential failure modes




Present as a comprehensive analytical comparison that highlights relative strengths rather than reaching a single recommendation.
