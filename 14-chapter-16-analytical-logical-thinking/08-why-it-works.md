title: Why It Works

## Why It Works:

- Multi-dimensional evaluation prevents oversimplified comparison.
- Scenario-specific analysis acknowledges that optimal solutions often depend on context.
- Limitations documentation ensures a balanced assessment.
Optional Add-On: "Include a decision matrix that weights each dimension according to our specific context to determine the most appropriate approach for our situation."
