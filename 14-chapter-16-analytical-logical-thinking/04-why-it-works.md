## Why It Works:

- Criteria weighting forces explicit prioritization of factors.
- Sensitivity analysis determines the stability of the conclusion under various assumptions.
- Implementation considerations bridge from decision to action.
Optional Add-On: "Include decision tree analysis for any sequential or conditional elements of the decision."
