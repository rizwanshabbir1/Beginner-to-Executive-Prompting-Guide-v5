## Bonus Prompt: Assumption Testing

As a critical thinking coach, create a framework for identifying and testing the key assumptions underlying our [PLAN/STRATEGY/CONCLUSION].





Develop an assumption analysis that includes the following:

- Structured approach to surfacing implicit assumptions
- Classification of assumptions by type (factual, causal, predictive, etc.)
- Assessment of each assumption's criticality to conclusions
- Evidence standards for validating different types of assumptions
- Testing methodologies for key assumptions
- Alternative perspectives that challenge central assumptions
- Sensitivity analysis showing how conclusions change if assumptions prove incorrect




Format as an analytical framework that strengthens critical thinking by systematically examining the foundation of our reasoning.
