## Bonus Prompt: Leadership Team Alignment

As an organizational alignment consultant, I design a structured approach to build consensus among my leadership team on our [STRATEGIC INITIATIVE].





Our team comprises seven executives with diverse functional backgrounds and priorities. Several have expressed competing perspectives on implementation approach and resource allocation.





Create a framework that includes:

- Pre-work materials to establish shared understanding
- A half-day workshop design with specific exercises
- Decision-making methods for resolving key points of disagreement
- Post-meeting accountability mechanisms
- Success metrics for both the alignment process and implementation outcomes




Optimize for both efficiency and psychological safety while making informed decisions.
