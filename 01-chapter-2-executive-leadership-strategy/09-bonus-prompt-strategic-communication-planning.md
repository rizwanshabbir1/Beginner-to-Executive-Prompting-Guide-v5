## Bonus Prompt: Strategic Communication Planning

As a strategic communication advisor, create a comprehensive 90-day messaging plan for our upcoming [INITIATIVE/CHANGE].





This plan will affect multiple stakeholders, including [LIST KEY STAKEHOLDERS].





Develop a communication strategy that includes:

- Core narrative and key messages tailored to each stakeholder group
- Sequencing and timing recommendations (what to communicate when)
- Format and channel recommendations for different message components
- 
- Potential resistance points and preemptive messaging approaches
- Feedback mechanisms to gauge message effectiveness




Format this as a strategic communication playbook that our leadership team can implement consistently.
