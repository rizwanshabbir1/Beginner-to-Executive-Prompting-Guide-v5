## Introduction

Healthcare and medical professionals handle complex clinical information that must be accurately communicated to various stakeholders, including clinicians and patients. AI prompting can enhance these functions by summarizing medical literature, translating clinical information for patients, documenting care encounters, and organizing research findings. The prompts in this chapter help healthcare professionals improve both efficiency and clarity in medical communications.

Effective healthcare prompting requires accuracy, appropriate terminology, patient-centered approaches, and compliance with healthcare communication standards. These specialized prompt frameworks support various healthcare

workflows—from clinical documentation and patient education to research analysis and interdisciplinary communication—while maintaining the precision required in medical contexts.
