## The Art & Science of Crafting Effective Prompts

Successful AI instructions provide clarity, background information, and specific guidance. Unlike general questions, well-formed instructions include:

- Clear objective: What specific result are you seeking?
- Background information: Relevant context the AI should consider
- Structure preferences: How should the response be organized?
- Stylistic guidance: What voice or approach should the AI adopt?
- Output structure: What output instructions or constraints should it follow?




Use simple words and avoid ambiguity and complexity. Favor clarity over brevity. For instance, spell out abbreviations.

Remember, AI is more than just a tool—it’s a thought partner and assistant with access to vast knowledge and data. Use it iteratively, challenge its responses, and learn how to harness it effectively.
