## 

As a client needs analyst, design a comprehensive discovery process for understanding [CLIENT TYPE]'s requirements for [PRODUCT/SERVICE/SOLUTION].





Create a structured needs assessment that includes:

- Pre-meeting research approach and information gathering
- Staged questioning framework moving from broad context to specific requirements
- Stakeholder interview guide for different roles and perspectives
- Current state assessment methodology
- Future state visioning process
- Prioritization approach for requirements and success criteria
- Documentation format for findings and recommendations




Format as a discovery playbook that uncovers both explicit and implicit needs while establishing your credibility as a partner rather than just a vendor.
