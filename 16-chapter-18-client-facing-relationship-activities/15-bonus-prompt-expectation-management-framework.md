As a client success strategist, develop an expectation management framework for our [PROJECT/ENGAGEMENT/RELATIONSHIP].





Create a structured approach that includes the following:

- Initial expectation-setting process and deliverables
- Explicit agreement on roles, responsibilities, and boundaries
- Communication protocols for different situations (routine, urgent, issues)
- Change management process for scope or requirement shifts
- Progress reporting format and frequency
- Issue escalation and resolution pathway
- Success definition and evaluation methodology
- 
Format as a proactive expectation management system that prevents misalignment while fostering transparent communication about project realities.
