## Bonus Prompt: Feature Prioritization Framework

As a product management consultant, create a structured prioritization framework for our feature backlog, which currently consists of [NUMBER] items.





Design a prioritization system that includes the following:



- 4-5 evaluation criteria with clear definitions and scoring guidelines
- Weighting methodology for balancing different criteria
- Scoring approach with examples of high/medium/low ratings
- Visualization method for displaying priority results
- Process for handling stakeholder input and conflicting priorities
- Cadence recommendation for priority reviews and adjustments




Format as a repeatable prioritization framework that balances customer value, business impact, and technical feasibility while providing clear reasoning for decisions.
