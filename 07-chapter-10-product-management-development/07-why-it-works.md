title: Why It Works

## Why It Works:

- Categorization prevents feature bloat by separating the core from the nice-to-have features.
- Complexity and impact ratings facilitate prioritization discussions.
Optional Add-On: "Suggest one innovative way each differentiator feature could be implemented to maximize impact while minimizing complexity."
