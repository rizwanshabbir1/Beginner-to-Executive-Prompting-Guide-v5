## Implementing Day-to-Day Responsible Practices

Translating principles into daily habits requires practical structures and frameworks. Start by establishing documentation requirements for AI-assisted decisions. While not every interaction needs documentation, maintain records for consequential choices that include:

- The specific AI tools used
- Key prompts or inputs provided
- The unedited AI output
- Human modifications or decisions made based on AI recommendations
- The rationale for accepting or rejecting AI suggestions
This documentation serves multiple purposes: it creates accountability, enables pattern recognition across decisions, facilitates learning from both successes and failures and provides evidence of due diligence if questions arise later.

Create feedback loops to improve AI systems over time. Establish simple mechanisms for team members to report problematic outputs, unexpected behaviors, or particularly



effective interactions. These insights help identify where additional guidance, training, or system adjustments might be needed.

Foster cross-functional collaboration around AI oversight. Different perspectives help catch potential issues—legal teams might spot compliance concerns, marketing might identify brand inconsistencies, and customer service might recognize usability challenges. Creating regular touchpoints across these functions strengthens your

overall governance.

Effective AI governance additionally requires transparent escalation pathways for addressing identified concerns. Every professional interacting with AI systems should clearly understand the following:

- Which specific AI behaviors or outputs warrant immediate escalation
- The appropriate organizational contacts for different categories of concerns
- Essential information to include when documenting problematic interactions
- Expected response timeframes for various urgency levels
- How reported issues influence ongoing system improvements
These escalation protocols should prioritize accessibility and clarity—overly complex procedures frequently go unused, while straightforward frameworks encourage consistent reporting. Many organizations implement simple structured templates that standardize issue documentation, ensuring comprehensive information capture while minimizing reporting friction.
