## The Intervention Framework

How can we apply these principles in practice? The most effective organizations develop clear frameworks for human intervention in AI processes. These frameworks identify high-stakes decision points where errors could have a significant impact on individuals, business outcomes, or reputation.

Consider implementing tiered review processes based on risk levels:

- Low-risk, routine tasks might need only spot-checking and occasional review
- Medium-risk decisions benefit from regular sampling and pattern analysis
- High-consequence decisions require consistent human review and often benefit from the "four-eyes principle"â€”having two different people evaluate important decisions before finalization
These review frameworks aren't implemented arbitrarily but are calibrated through

thoughtful risk assessment. Organizations systematically document specific indicators that should trigger enhanced scrutiny:

- Content containing uncharacteristic recommendations that deviate from historical patterns or established business practices
- Outputs addressing legally sensitive domains such as regulatory compliance, employment guidance, or financial counsel
- Communications that will represent the organization publicly or reach substantial external audiences
- Determinations that significantly impact individual stakeholders' opportunities, finances, or experiences
- Responses where the AI system itself displays markers of uncertainty, such as equivocation, conflicting rationales, or multiple conditional statements
- 
Most importantly, effective intervention frameworks adapt to industry-specific contexts. Regulated sectors, such as healthcare, financial services, and government, naturally demand more extensive human involvement than content generation or internal knowledge management. The calibration of these frameworks reflects both regulatory requirements and the organization's risk tolerance.
