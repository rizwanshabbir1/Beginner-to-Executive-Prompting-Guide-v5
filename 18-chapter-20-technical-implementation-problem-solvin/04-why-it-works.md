## Why It Works:

- Systematic isolation prevents random trial-and-error approaches.
- The decision tree structure guides logical progression through diagnosis.
- The documentation component captures knowledge for future reference.
Optional Add-On: "Include a severity assessment framework to determine appropriate response urgency and resource allocation."
