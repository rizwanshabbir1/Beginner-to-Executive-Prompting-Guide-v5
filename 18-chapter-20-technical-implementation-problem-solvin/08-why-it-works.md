## Why It Works:

- Multiple levels of detail serve diverse audience needs.
- Process flows capture dynamic behaviors beyond static descriptions.
- Maintenance and change management aspects ensure documentation remains current.
Optional Add-On: "Include a documentation template structure that can be applied consistently across systems or processes."
