## Why It Works:

- External/internal balance prevents either market or capability myopia.
- Gap analysis creates a clear direction for capability development.
- Prioritization prevents attempting too many strategic initiatives simultaneously.
Optional Add-On: "Include a core competency evaluation that identifies sustainable advantages that could be extended to new opportunities."
