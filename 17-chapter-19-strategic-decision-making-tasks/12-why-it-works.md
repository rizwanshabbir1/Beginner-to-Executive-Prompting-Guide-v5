title: Why It Works

## Why It Works:

- Multi-dimensional criteria prevent over-focusing on financial metrics alone.
- Competitive response consideration acknowledges dynamic market realities.
- The staging approach allows for milestone-based commitment rather than all-or-nothing decisions.
Optional Add-On: "Include an opportunity portfolio view that shows how this opportunity fits with other initiatives in terms of risk/reward profile and resource requirements."
