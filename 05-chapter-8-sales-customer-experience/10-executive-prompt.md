## Executive Prompt:

You are an email marketing strategist specializing in sales sequences. Design a complete 5-email prospecting sequence for [PRODUCT/SERVICE] targeting [BUYER PERSONA]. For each email, include: 1) a compelling subject line with 2-3 variants to test, 2) concise body copy (max 150 words) following a clear, persuasive structure, 3) specific call-to-action, 4) optimal send timing and trigger conditions, and 5) purpose within the overall sequence. The sequence should tell a cohesive story across all emails, addressing key pain points and objections while building interest and engagement. Include guidance on personalization elements and a follow-up approach if prospects engage but don't convert.
