title: Why It Works
---

## Why It Works:

- The email strategist role activates conversion-focused communication expertise.
- Subject line variants enable testing and optimization.
- The word count constraint forces clarity and prevents the common occurrence of lengthy emails.
- The sequence purpose clarifies how each touch contributes to the overall goal.
Optional Add-On: "Include appropriate metrics to track for each email and the sequence as a whole."
