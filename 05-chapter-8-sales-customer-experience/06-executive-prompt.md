## Executive Prompt:

As a sales methodology expert specializing in complex sales, I will create a comprehensive framework for handling objections to our [PRODUCT/SERVICE]. First, categorize the top 10 objections by type (price, competition, timing, etc.). Then, for each objection, develop 1) an underlying translation of what the prospect is saying, 2) validation questions to understand better their specific concern, 3) a reframing approach to shifting perspective, 4) a value-focused response with supporting evidence, and 5) suggested next step to move the conversation forwardâ€”format as a practical guide for sales conversations, including examples of effective phrasing.
