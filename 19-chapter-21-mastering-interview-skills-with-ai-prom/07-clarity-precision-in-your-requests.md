## Clarity: Precision in Your Requests



Clarity involves stating your needs explicitly and specifically. Vague prompts produce generic responses that offer limited value for interview preparation. Instead of asking, "How do I prepare for interviews?" specify the exact type of guidance you need: particular question categories, response frameworks, or improvement areas.

Example of unclear prompt: "Give me interview help."

Example of clear prompt: "Generate five behavioral interview questions specifically for an entry-level marketing coordinator position, focusing on teamwork and

problem-solving scenarios."



The clear prompt specifies the question type (behavioral), quantity (five), role level (entry-level), function (marketing coordinator), and competency areas (teamwork and problem-solving), enabling AI to provide targeted, relevant questions.
