## Privacy and Security Considerations

Information Sharing: Be mindful of what personal or proprietary information you share with AI systems. Avoid including sensitive company details or confidential information in your practice sessions.

Platform Policies: Understand how different AI platforms handle your data. Some store conversations for improvement purposes, while others offer more privacy-focused approaches.

Professional Boundaries: Maintain appropriate boundaries between AI assistance and your professional reputation to ensure your credibility remains intact. Utilize AI as a preparatory tool, ensuring that all shared information accurately represents your authentic experiences and capabilities.
