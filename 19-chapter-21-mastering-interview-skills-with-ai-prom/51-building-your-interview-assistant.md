## Building Your Interview Assistant



Create a customized AI coaching experience by establishing persistent context and preferences:

Profile Development: Provide AI with your resume, target roles, and key experiences to create personalized coaching that builds upon your actual background rather than generic advice.

Progress Tracking: Document your areas for improvement and track progress over multiple practice sessions. This longitudinal approach enables more sophisticated coaching that addresses your specific development needs.

Question Libraries: Build databases of questions specific to your industry, role level, and career goals. This specialized collection becomes more valuable as you advance in your career and face increasingly sophisticated interview processes.
