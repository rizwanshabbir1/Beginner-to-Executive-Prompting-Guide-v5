## Sample Prompt:



Let's do a mock interview. You are an interviewer for a junior data analyst position at a technology company.





- Ask me one question at a time.


- After I answer (I'll either say it or type it), provide brief feedback on my answer and then the next question.
- Start by greeting me and asking the first question.


The AI will initiate a professional greeting and begin with a logical first question, such as: "Hello, thanks for coming in today. To start, could you tell me about yourself and why you're interested in this data analyst role?"

After each response, the AI provides constructive feedback focusing on content quality, structure, and areas for improvement. This immediate feedback loop accelerates learning and systematically builds interview skills.
