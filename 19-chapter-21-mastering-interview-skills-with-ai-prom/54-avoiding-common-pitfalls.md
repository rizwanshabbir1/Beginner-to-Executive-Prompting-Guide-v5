## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

Over-Polish Warning: Responses that sound too perfect can trigger suspicion. Maintain some conversational elements and personal touches that reflect your authentic personality. Interviewers want to hire humans, not robots.

Fact Verification: Always verify specific claims or information provided by AI, especially regarding companies, industry trends, or statistics, to ensure accuracy. AI can sometimes generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information.

Cultural Appropriateness: Ensure AI suggestions align with your cultural context and the Company's communication norms. What works in one setting might not translate effectively to another.
