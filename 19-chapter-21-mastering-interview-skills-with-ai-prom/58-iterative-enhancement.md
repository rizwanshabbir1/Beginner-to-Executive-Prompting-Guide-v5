## Iterative Enhancement

Feedback Integration: Incorporate feedback from actual interviews into your AI practice sessions to enhance your understanding of the data. If interviewers consistently ask follow-up questions about specific topics, practice those areas more thoroughly.

Role-Specific Adaptation: Tailor your approach to different roles and companies. What works for startup interviews might need adjustment for corporate environments or

technical roles.

Skill Development: Use AI to identify and address specific skill gaps revealed through

interview experiences. This might include technical knowledge, communication style, or industry awareness.
