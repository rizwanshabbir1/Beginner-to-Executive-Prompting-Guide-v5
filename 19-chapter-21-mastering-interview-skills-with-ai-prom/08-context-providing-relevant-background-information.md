## Context: Providing Relevant Background Information



Context helps AI understand your specific situation and tailor responses accordingly. This includes details about the target role, company type, your experience level, and any particular challenges you're facing. The more relevant context you provide, the more customized and helpful the AI's guidance becomes.

Context elements might include:



- Target job title and industry
- 
- Company size and culture
- Your background and experience level
- Specific interview format (phone, video, panel)
- Particular concerns or weaknesses you want to address
Example with rich context: "You are a career coach helping someone prepare for a software engineer interview at a financial technology startup. I have two years of experience in mobile app development but no direct experience in fintech. What

technical questions might I face, and how should I address my industry experience gap?"
