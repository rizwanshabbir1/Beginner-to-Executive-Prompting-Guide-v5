## Sentiment and Impression Management



Understanding how your responses might be perceived enables strategic refinement to create the intended impression.

Sentiment Analysis: Ask AI to evaluate the emotional tone of your responses. Are you projecting confidence or uncertainty? Do you sound enthusiastic about opportunities or defensive about challenges? This analysis helps calibrate your communication for maximum positive impact.

Bias Detection: AI can help identify language that might unconsciously create negative impressions. For example, excessive hedging ("I think maybe...") may signal a lack of confidence, while overusing "I" without acknowledging team contributions may suggest poor collaboration skills.

Cultural Sensitivity: When interviewing across diverse cultural contexts or in

international settings, AI can help ensure your responses are translated appropriately and avoid potential misunderstandings.
