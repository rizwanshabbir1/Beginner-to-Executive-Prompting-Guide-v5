Could you please provide a challenging interview question for a candidate applying for a new management position, one that tests their ability to solve problems under pressure? After I attempt an answer, critique it briefly.

The AI might present a complex scenario such as: "Imagine your team's performance drops suddenly next quarter. You've tried standard improvement approaches, but nothing works. How would you handle potentially having to lay off a team member?"

This type of challenging question tests your ability to think through difficult situations while maintaining professionalism and empathy.
