## Sample Prompt:



I want to answer the question, "Describe a time you faced a major challenge and how you overcame it," using the STAR method.





Situation/Task: In my senior year, I led a team project that fell behind schedule when two members quit. We had two weeks left to deliver a research report.





Action: I organized daily check-ins, redistributed tasks among remaining members, and personally took on extra data analysis. I also communicated honestly with our professor to manage expectations.





Result: We not only finished on time but scored 90%, and I learned how to motivate a team under pressure.





Now, draft this into a well-structured STAR answer I can deliver in about 2 minutes.
