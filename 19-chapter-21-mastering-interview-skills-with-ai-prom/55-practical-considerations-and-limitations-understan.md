## Practical Considerations and Limitations Understanding AI Capabilities and Constraints

Information Currency: AI knowledge has cutoff dates and may not include the most recent company developments or industry changesâ€”supplement AI research with current sources when discussing recent events.

Personalization Limits: While AI can provide excellent frameworks and suggestions, it cannot fully understand your unique personality, communication style, or specific career circumstances. Human judgment remains essential for final decisions.

Context Sensitivity: AI may not fully grasp subtle cultural, industry, or company-specific nuances that could influence interview dynamics. Combine AI insights with industry knowledge and networking conversations.
