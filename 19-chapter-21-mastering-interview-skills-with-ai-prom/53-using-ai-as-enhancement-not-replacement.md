## Using AI as Enhancement, Not Replacement

Content Foundation: Use AI to structure your genuine experiences and perspectives rather than generating fictional examples or responses. Your authentic stories and motivations provide the raw material; AI helps organize and present them effectively.

Personal Voice: Tailor AI suggestions to align with your natural communication style. Formal AI language might not suit your personality or the company culture. Modify responses to sound like you while retaining structural improvements.

Genuine Preparation: Focus on understanding rather than memorization. AI helps you think through potential questions and develop talking points. Still, your actual interview responses should flow naturally from this preparation rather than being scripted.
