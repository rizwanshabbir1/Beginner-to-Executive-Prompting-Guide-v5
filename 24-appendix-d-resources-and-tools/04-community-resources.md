By applying the techniques, frameworks, and examples in this guide, you can transform how you interact with AI tools and significantly improve the quality and relevance of the results you receive. Remember that effective prompting is an iterative process - save

successful instructions, learn from suboptimal outcomes, and continuously refine your approach based on the specific AI system and task at hand.

Develop a structured diagnostic approach including:

- Initial information gathering requirements and system state assessment
- Systematic isolation methodology to narrow down potential causes
- A diagnostic decision tree with specific tests and expected results
- Common failure patterns and their distinctive symptoms
- Resolution procedures for each identified root cause
- Verification testing to confirm proper restoration of functionality
- Documentation approach for the issue, root cause, and resolution
Format as a technical troubleshooting playbook that moves from symptoms to solutions through a logical, systematic process while creating knowledge for future issue prevention.
